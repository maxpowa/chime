A mod that adds some social elements to Minecraft.

The only data about your Mojang account that is stored on the backend server is your account UUID (for identification) and your username (for reference to UUID). Any other data is created by this mod and has nothing to do with your Mojang account.

This mod is powered by Firebase, which does have some restrictions on usage. Please donate if you want to keep this mod alive!
